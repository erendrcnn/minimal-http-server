# minimal-http-server
This repository contains a Python program with basic HTTP server functionality. It handles file uploads, data processing, and request handling for simple HTTP server tasks. The server processes POST and GET requests from browsers or API clients and runs on localhost by default with a simple file writing/reading mechanism.
